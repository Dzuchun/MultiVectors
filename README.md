# MultiVectors

This is a python implementation of 3-D MultiVectors and some usage cases of them.

## Graphics

At the moment, if multivectors.py is lunched as a script, you would be able to see some distributed points in 3d-space rotating around some axis.
At least on my machine rendering is kind of slow, so I pre-rendered some of it in an animation.mp4 file:
